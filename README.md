# Angular Dependency Analyzer

A powerful Angular application for analyzing and visualizing npm package dependencies. This tool helps developers understand the dependency tree of npm packages, including their versions, dependencies, and metadata from the npm registry.

## Features

- üîç **Dependency Analysis**: Analyze any npm package and its entire dependency tree
- üìä **Visual Representation**: View dependencies in an organized, hierarchical structure
- üé® **JSON Viewer**: Syntax-highlighted JSON display using Prism.js
- üöÄ **Modern Stack**: Built with Angular 20.2.0 and Bootstrap 5
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across different screen sizes

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.2.0.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
